# BxxT-s-mod-menu-
This gta 5 mod menu is made in lua it can do alot of stuff such as spawn cars, god mode etc

# How to open?

Its pretty simple 

``For xbox: R3``
``For psn: R3``
``For pc: F3``

Navagate: dpad, A to select and B to back out
Arrowkeys for pc, enter and backspace.

# What do I need? 

You will need the following: Script Hook V and GTALua

# What else?

Uh you kinda have to figure out if this menu works on rockstar games and epic games since I only have gta for steam.

# Current version: ``Version 2.0.0``

# Current notes: 

``The speedometer actually saves inside the game so you wont have to select it every time!``

``Planning on switching to LemonUI once I get the hang of it.``

# THIS DOES NOT WORK ONLINE YOU WILL GET BANNED IF YOU USE IT!
